## Installation

### Home Assistant

Using Home Assistant? Install KOShelf as an add-on with just one click below.

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the dashboard of an add-on.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_addon.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_addon/?addon=5d189d71_koshelf&repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fpaviro%2Fhome-assistant-addons)

### Prebuilt Binaries

The easiest way to get started is to download a prebuilt binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/paviro/koshelf/releases). Binaries are available for:

- Windows (x64)
- macOS (Apple Silicon, Intel & Universal)
- Linux (x64 and ARM64)

Please note that KoShelf is a command line tool, so you will need to execute it from within a terminal (macOS/Linux) or PowerShell/Command Prompt on Windows. Simply double-clicking the executable won't work since it requires command line arguments to function properly.

**Note for Windows users**: Windows Defender will likely flag and delete the Windows binary as a virus (more information [here](https://medium.com/opsops/is-windows-broken-7f8de8b8f3ad)). This is a false positive if you downloaded the binary directly from this repo. To use the binary:

1. Restore it from Windows Defender's protection history (Windows Security > Virus & threat protection > Protection history > Restore)
2. Launch the binary from PowerShell or Windows Terminal with arguments - double-clicking will cause it to close immediately since no arguments are provided

#### First Time Using Command Line?

If you've never used a command line before, here's how to get started:

**Windows:**
1. Press `Win + R`, type `powershell`, and press Enter
2. Navigate to where you downloaded the KoShelf binary (e.g., `cd C:\Users\YourName\Downloads`)
3. Run the tool with your desired arguments (see examples below)

**macOS and Linux:**
1. Press `Cmd + Space`, type `terminal`, and press Enter
2. Navigate to where you downloaded the KoShelf binary (e.g., `cd ~/Downloads`)
3. Make the file executable: `chmod +x koshelf` (should not be needed on macOS as the binary is signed)
4. Run the tool with your desired arguments (see examples below)

**Example:**
```bash
# Navigate to your downloads folder
cd ~/Downloads  # macOS/Linux
cd C:\Users\YourName\Downloads  # Windows

# Run KoShelf with your books folder
./koshelf --books-path /path/to/your/books --output ./my-library-site
```

**Pro tip:** On most terminals, you can drag and drop the downloaded binary file directly into the terminal window. This will automatically insert the full file path, allowing you to immediately add your arguments and run the command.

If you plan to use KoShelf frequently and use Linux or macOS, you can move the binary to `/usr/local/bin/` to make it available system-wide. This allows you to run `koshelf` from anywhere without specifying the full path:

```bash
# Move the binary to system PATH (requires sudo)
sudo mv koshelf /usr/local/bin/

# Now you can run it from anywhere
koshelf --books-path ~/Books --output ~/my-library-site
```

### From Source

If you prefer to build from source or need a custom build:

#### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+ (for building)
- Node.js and npm (for Tailwind CSS compilation)

#### Building the tool

```bash
git clone https://github.com/paviro/KOShelf
cd koshelf

# Build the Rust binary
cargo build --release
```

The binary will be available at `target/release/koshelf`.

**Note:** Tailwind CSS will be compiled during build and added to the binary.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
./koshelf --books-path /path/to/your/books --output ./my-library-site
```

### Operation Modes

KoShelf can operate in several modes:

1. **Static Site Generation**: Generate a static site once and exit (default when `--output` is specified without `--watch`)
2. **Web Server Mode**: Builds a static site in a temporary folder and serves it, automatically rebuilds on book changes (default when `--output` is not specified) 
3. **Watch Mode**: Generate a static site, rebuilding when book files change (when both `--output` and `--watch` are specified)

### Command Line Options

- `-b, --books-path`: Path to your folder containing EPUB files and KoReader metadata (optional if `--statistics-db` is provided)
- `-s, --statistics-db`: Path to the `statistics.sqlite3` file for additional reading stats (optional if `--books-path` is provided)
- `-o, --output`: Output directory for the generated site
- `-p, --port`: Port for web server mode (default: 3000)
- `-w, --watch`: Enable file watching with static output (requires `--output`)
- `-t, --title`: Site title (default: "KoShelf")
- `--heatmap-scale-max`: Maximum value for heatmap color intensity scaling (e.g., "auto", "1h", "1h30m", "45min"). Values above this will still be shown but use the highest color intensity. Default is "auto" for automatic scaling
- `--include-unread`: Include unread books (EPUBs without KoReader metadata)
- `--timezone`: Timezone to interpret timestamps (IANA name, e.g., `Australia/Sydney`); defaults to system local
- `--day-start-time`: Logical day start time as `HH:MM` (default: `00:00`)
- `--github`: Print GitHub repository URL

### Example

```bash
# Generate site from Books folder
./koshelf -b ~/Books -o ~/my-reading-site -t "My Reading Journey"

# Generate site with statistics and unread books included
./koshelf -b ~/Books -o ~/my-reading-site --statistics-db ~/KOReaderSettings/statistics.sqlite3 --include-unread

# Start web server with live file watching and statistics
./koshelf -b ~/Books -s ~/KOReaderSettings/statistics.sqlite3 -p 8080

# Generate static site with file watching and statistics
./koshelf --books-path ~/Books -o ~/my-reading-site --statistics-db ~/KOReaderSettings/statistics.sqlite3 --watch

# Generate site with custom heatmap color scaling (2 hours = highest intensity)
./koshelf -b ~/Books -s ~/KOReaderSettings/statistics.sqlite3 -o ~/my-reading-site --heatmap-scale-max 2h

# Generate site with custom heatmap color scaling (1.5 hours = highest intensity)
./koshelf -b ~/Books -s ~/KOReaderSettings/statistics.sqlite3 -o ~/my-reading-site --heatmap-scale-max 1h30m

# Generate site with explicit timezone and non-midnight day start (good for night owls)
./koshelf -b ~/Books -s ~/KOReaderSettings/statistics.sqlite3 -o ~/my-reading-site --timezone Australia/Sydney --day-start-time 03:00
```

## KoReader Setup

This tool expects your books to be organized like this:

```
Books/
├── Book Title.epub
├── Book Title.sdr/
│   └── metadata.epub.lua
├── Another Book.epub
├── Another Book.sdr/
│   └── metadata.epub.lua
└── ...
```

The `.sdr` directories are automatically created by KoReader when you read books and make highlights/annotations.
Although KOReader supports more than just EPUBs, this tool does not, and probably never will, as I don't use them and this is a weekend project that probably won't be maintained much.

### Typical Deployment Setup

Although there are many ways to use this tool here is how I use it:

1. **Syncthing Sync**: I use [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) to sync both my books folder and KoReader settings folder from my e-reader to my server
2. **Books and Statistics**: I point to the synced books folder with `--books-path` and to `statistics.sqlite3` in the synced KoReader settings folder with `--statistics-db`
3. **Web Server Mode**: I then run KoShelf in web server mode (without `--output`) - it will automatically rebuild when files change
4. **Nginx Reverse Proxy**: I use an nginx reverse proxy for HTTPS and to restrict access

My actual setup:
```bash
# My server command - runs continuously with file watching and statistics
./koshelf --books-path ~/syncthing/Books \
         --statistics-db ~/syncthing/KOReaderSettings/statistics.sqlite3 \
         --port 3000
```

This way, every time Syncthing pulls updates from my e-reader, the website automatically updates with my latest reading progress, new highlights, and updated statistics.

## Credits

Design and feature inspiration taken from [KoInsight](https://github.com/GeorgeSG/KoInsight) - an excellent alternative that focuses more on statistics and also supports acting as a KOReader sync server. If you're primarily interested in reading stats rather than highlights and annotations, definitely check it out!

The calendar feature is powered by [EventCalendar](https://github.com/vkurko/calendar) - a lightweight, full-featured JavaScript event calendar library.

Styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for modern, responsive design.
